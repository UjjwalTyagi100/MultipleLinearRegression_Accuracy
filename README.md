# Multiple Linear Regression with 50 Startups Dataset with evaluation of the performance of model.

This repository demonstrates the use of Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of startups based on various features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains data from 50 startups, including:

-> R&D Spend
-> Administration
-> Marketing Spend
-> State
-> Profit

# Code Explanation

## Importing the Libraries:

We start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and building the regression model.

## Importing the Dataset:

We load the dataset and separate the independent variables (X) from the dependent variable (y).

## Splitting the Dataset into the Training Set and Test Set:

The dataset is split into training and test sets with an 80-20 ratio.

## Training the Multiple Linear Regression Model:

We create and train the Multiple Linear Regression model using the training set.

## Predicting the Test Set Results:

The model predicts the results for the test set, and we print a comparison between the predicted and actual profits.

## Evaluating the Model Performance:

The performance of the model is evaluated using the R-squared (R²) score, which measures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the application of Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of startups using key financial metrics. The R² score helps assess the accuracy of the model.
